# MDTrajFPS
MDTrajFPS is tool to calculate FRET observables from MD-trajectories.

mdtraj-fps depends on MDTraj and utilizes the original libraries published together with the "FRET Positioning System" (FPS) in Nature Methods 9, 1218â€“1225 (2012) "A toolkit and benchmark study for FRET-restrained high-precision structural modeling". 

With MDTrajFPS, you can

- Process every MD format supported by MDTraj
- Calculate FRET efficienes using a fast implicit dye model
- Save calculated positional distributions of dyes for later vizualization
