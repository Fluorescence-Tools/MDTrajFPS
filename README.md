# MDTrajFPS
MDTrajFPS is tool to calculate FRET observables from MD-trajectories.

MDTrajFPS depends on MDTraj and utilizes the original libraries published together with the "FRET Positioning System" (FPS) in Nature Methods 9, 1218â€“1225 (2012) "A toolkit and benchmark study for FRET-restrained high-precision structural modeling". 

The implicit model of the label is being improved to support the latest developments

Hence, the library for the calculation of the implicit labels are currently only provided as pre-compiled binaries for (Windows x32, x64, MacOS, and Linux x32, x64). 

With MDTrajFPS, you can

- Process every MD format supported by MDTraj
- Calculate FRET efficienes using a fast implicit dye model
- Save calculated positional distributions of dyes for later vizualization

The original FPS-software package is available at http://www.mpc.hhu.de/software/fps.html.
